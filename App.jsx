      'This fertilizer contains 10% nitrogen, 26% phosphorus, and 26% potassium.',
      'Suitable for crops like potatoes, tobacco, sugarcane, and vegetables, which need a balanced supply of phosphorus and potassium.'

      'The 14-35-14 fertilizer is designed to provide a higher amount of phosphorus relative to nitrogen and potassium, making it ideal for early-stage growth and root development.',
      'This fertilizer contains 14% nitrogen, 35% phosphorus, and 14% potassium.',

      'This fertilizer contains 28% nitrogen and 28% phosphorus.',
      'Suitable for crops like maize, wheat, and other cereals, where potassium is less critical, and a strong focus on nitrogen and phosphorus is needed.'
    ],
    '20-20': [
      'The 20-20 fertilizer is similar to 28-28 but with a lower concentration of nutrients. It provides a balanced amount of nitrogen and phosphorus without potassium.',
      'This fertilizer contains 20% nitrogen and 20% phosphorus.',
      'Ideal for cereals, oilseeds, and other crops where potassium is less essential, but balanced nitrogen and phosphorus are required.'
